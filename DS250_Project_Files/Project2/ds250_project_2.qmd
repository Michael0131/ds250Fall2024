_THIS `.qmd` FILE SHOULD BE USED TO WRITE YOUR REPORT.  YOU WILL NEED TO COMPILE THE REPORT INTO A `.html` DOCUMENT AND SUBMIT IT ON CANVAS._

```{python}
#| label: libraries
#| include: false
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from lets_plot import *
LetsPlot.setup_html()

import ssl
ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context

```


```{python}
# Load any data you need for the report
# df = pd.read_csv('filename.csv')

```


## Elevator pitch

PLACE YOUR "30 SECOND" SALES PITCH HERE.  What are you trying to show in this report?


```{python}
# Any code for your pitch

```

## |Task 1
# Fix all of the varied missing data types in the data to be consistent (all missing values should be displayed as “NaN”). In your report include one record example (one row) from your new data, in the raw JSON format. Your example should display the “NaN” for at least one missing value. 


ADD YOUR COMMENTS HERE. Explain any data, charts or tables

```{python}
#| label: Q1
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from lets_plot import *
LetsPlot.setup_html()
# Ensure the correct file path and method for reading
file_path = "flights_missing.json"  # Update with the actual path to your CSV file
df = pd.read_json(file_path)

# Ensure the correct file path and method for reading
file_path = "flights_missing.json"  # Update with the actual path to your file
df = pd.read_json(file_path)

# Replace the varied missing values with np.nan as discussed in the article
df = df.replace({"1500+": np.nan, -999: np.nan})

# Convert np.nan values to the string "NaN" for reporting purposes only
df = df.replace({np.nan: "NaN"})

# Print one row from the DataFrame to show the changes, with "NaN" as missing values
print(df.iloc[0].to_json())



```

## |Task 2
# Which airport has the worst delays? Describe the metric you chose, and why you chose it to determine the “worst” airport. Your answer should include a summary table that lists (for each airport) the total number of flights, total number of delayed flights, proportion of delayed flights, and average delay time in hours.

#| label: Q2
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from lets_plot import *
LetsPlot.setup_html()

file_path = "flights_missing.json"  # Update with the actual path to your CSV file
df = pd.read_json(file_path)

# Ensure the correct file path and method for reading
file_path = "flights_missing.json"  # Update with the actual path to your file
df = pd.read_json(file_path)
# Calculate total delays and total delay minutes for each airport
airport_delays = df.groupby("airport_code").agg(
    total_delays=("num_of_delays_total", "sum"),
    total_delay_minutes=("minutes_delayed_total", "sum")
).reset_index()

# Calculate the average delay duration per delayed flight in hours
airport_delays["average_delay_hours"] = (airport_delays["total_delay_minutes"] / airport_delays["total_delays"]) / 60

# Find the airport with the highest delay count and longest average delay time
# Sort by total delays and average delay hours to identify the "worst" airport
worst_airports = airport_delays.sort_values(by=["total_delays", "average_delay_hours"], ascending=[False, False])

# Display the result to find where high delay count and long average delay intersect
import ace_tools as tools; tools.display_dataframe_to_user(name="Worst Airports by Delay Frequency and Duration", dataframe=worst_airports)

```



## |Task 3
# What is the best month to fly if you want to avoid delays of any length? Describe the metric you chose and why you chose it to calculate your answer. Include one chart to help support your answer, with the x-axis ordered by month. (To answer this question, you will need to remove any rows that are missing the Month variable.)

## |Task 4
# According to the BTS website, the “Weather” category only accounts for severe weather delays. Mild weather delays are not counted in the “Weather” category, but are actually included in both the “NAS” and “Late-Arriving Aircraft” categories. Your job is to create a new column that calculates the total number of flights delayed by weather (both severe and mild). You will need to replace all the missing values in the Late Aircraft variable with the mean. Show your work by printing the first 5 rows of data in a table. Use these three rules for your calculations:

# A. 100% of delayed flights in the Weather category are due to weather
# B. 30% of all delayed flights in the Late-Arriving category are due to weather
# C. From April to August, 40% of delayed flights in the NAS category are due to weather. The rest of the months, the proportion rises to 65%

## |Task 5
# Using the new weather variable calculated above, create a barplot showing the proportion of all flights that are delayed by weather at each airport. Describe what you learn from this graph.
