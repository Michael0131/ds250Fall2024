_THIS `.qmd` FILE SHOULD BE USED TO WRITE YOUR REPORT.  YOU WILL NEED TO COMPILE THE REPORT INTO A `.html` DOCUMENT AND SUBMIT IT ON CANVAS._

PLACE YOUR "30 SECOND" SALES PITCH HERE.  What are you trying to show in this report?


```{python}
# Any code for your pitch

```

## |Task 1
# Fix all of the varied missing data types in the data to be consistent (all missing values should be displayed as “NaN”). In your report include one record example (one row) from your new data, in the raw JSON format. Your example should display the “NaN” for at least one missing value. 


ADD YOUR COMMENTS HERE. Explain any data, charts or tables

```{python}
#| label: Q1
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here
import pandas as pd

from lets_plot import *
LetsPlot.setup_html()
# Ensure the correct file path and method for reading

df = pd.read_json(file_path)

# Ensure the correct file path and method for reading
file_path = "flights_missing.json"  # Update with the actual path to your file
df = pd.read_json(file_path)

# Replace the varied missing values with np.nan as discussed in the article
df = df.replace({"1500+": np.nan, -999: np.nan})

# Convert np.nan values to the string "NaN" for reporting purposes only
df = df.replace({np.nan: "NaN"})

# Print one row from the DataFrame to show the changes, with "NaN" as missing values
print(df.iloc[0].to_json())



```

## |Task 2
# Which airport has the worst delays? Describe the metric you chose, and why you chose it to determine the “worst” airport. Your answer should include a summary table that lists (for each airport) the total number of flights, total number of delayed flights, proportion of delayed flights, and average delay time in hours.


The data includes information on flights from various airports, such as the total number of flights, the number of delayed flights, and the total minutes of delay. A summary table was created to present key metrics for each airport: total flights, total delayed flights, proportion of delayed flights, and average delay time in hours. This table allows us to compare airports based on delay frequency and duration. Using these metrics, the analysis identified the worst-performing airport by prioritizing high delay proportions and, when frequencies were close, selecting the airport with the longest average delay time. This approach highlights airports with both frequent and severe delays, offering a clear view of their performance.

# Setup for LetsPlot visualization

# Load data

df = pd.read_json(file_path)

# Calculate required metrics
airport_delays = df.groupby("airport_code").agg(
    total_flights=("num_of_flights_total", "sum"),
    total_delays=("num_of_delays_total", "sum"),
    total_delay_minutes=("minutes_delayed_total", "sum")
).reset_index()

# Calculate additional columns for analysis
airport_delays["proportion_delayed_flights"] = airport_delays["total_delays"] / airport_delays["total_flights"]
airport_delays["average_delay_hours"] = (airport_delays["total_delay_minutes"] / airport_delays["total_delays"]) / 60

# Sort by proportion of delayed flights and average delay hours
airport_delays = airport_delays.sort_values(by=["proportion_delayed_flights", "average_delay_hours"], ascending=[False, False])

# Define threshold for "close" delay frequencies
proportion_threshold = 0.02  # e.g., within 2% difference in delay frequency

# Find the airport with the highest delay proportion
highest_delay_proportion = airport_delays["proportion_delayed_flights"].max()
high_frequency_airports = airport_delays[
    airport_delays["proportion_delayed_flights"] >= highest_delay_proportion - proportion_threshold
]

# Among the high-frequency delay airports, select the one with the longest delay hours
if len(high_frequency_airports) > 1:
    # Sort by average delay hours within the high-frequency group to find the longest delays
    worst_airport = high_frequency_airports.sort_values(by="average_delay_hours", ascending=False).head(1)
else:
    # If there's only one airport in the high-frequency group, it is the "worst" airport
    worst_airport = high_frequency_airports

# Display results
print("Airport Delay Summary:")
print(airport_delays)
print("\nWorst Airport Based on High Delay Frequency and Long Delay Duration:")
print(worst_airport)

```



## |Task 3
# What is the best month to fly if you want to avoid delays of any length? Describe the metric you chose and why you chose it to calculate your answer. Include one chart to help support your answer, with the x-axis ordered by month. (To answer this question, you will need to remove any rows that are missing the Month variable.)

## |Task 4
# According to the BTS website, the “Weather” category only accounts for severe weather delays. Mild weather delays are not counted in the “Weather” category, but are actually included in both the “NAS” and “Late-Arriving Aircraft” categories. Your job is to create a new column that calculates the total number of flights delayed by weather (both severe and mild). You will need to replace all the missing values in the Late Aircraft variable with the mean. Show your work by printing the first 5 rows of data in a table. Use these three rules for your calculations:

# A. 100% of delayed flights in the Weather category are due to weather
# B. 30% of all delayed flights in the Late-Arriving category are due to weather
# C. From April to August, 40% of delayed flights in the NAS category are due to weather. The rest of the months, the proportion rises to 65%
