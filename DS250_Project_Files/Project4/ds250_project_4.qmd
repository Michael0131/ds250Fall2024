## Elevator pitch

This project delivers a robust predictive model to identify whether homes in Denver were built before 1980, addressing critical gaps in Colorado's residential dwelling data. With a classification accuracy exceeding 92%, this model leverages key features like square footage, construction style, and quality ratings to differentiate homes. Patterns revealed through exploratory charts and precise metrics illustrate distinct correlations between home attributes and build periods. These insights not only highlight the model's reliability but also provide actionable intelligence for further housing safety evaluations. Explore the data and findings to uncover the story behind Denver’s evolving housing trends.

## Question|Task 1

Instructions: 
Create 2-3 charts that evaluate potential relationships between the home variables and before1980. Explain what you learn from the charts that could help a machine learning algorithm.

Info: 
The bar plot shows that homes built before 1980 are more likely to have moderate or low condition ratings, while those built after 1980 tend to have higher condition ratings. This distinction suggests condition is a useful predictor for classifying whether a home was built before 1980.

The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between square footage and sale price, with homes built before 1980 generally clustering at lower square footage and sale prices. While there is overlap, square footage and sale price provide some predictive value for distinguishing between the two groups. Homes with extreme square footage (>10,000 sqft) were excluded for clarity.

## Question|Task 2

Instructions: 
Build a classification model labeling houses as being built “before 1980” or “during or after 1980”. Your goal is to reach or exceed 90% accuracy. Explain your final model choice (algorithm, tuning parameters, etc) and describe what other models you tried.

Info: 
The dataset was cleaned to remove outliers (e.g., homes with over 10,000 square feet) and encoded categorical variables like condition and quality. Features were selected based on relevance to predicting before1980.

The Random Forest Classifier achieved 92.43% accuracy, exceeding the 90% goal. Metrics like precision and recall were above 90%, confirming strong performance in distinguishing houses built before and after 1980. The confusion matrix and classification report validated the model's reliability.

Model Choice and Performance

The Random Forest Classifier was selected for its ability to handle mixed data types and complex relationships. It achieved an accuracy of 92.43%, exceeding the 90% goal, with high precision and recall.

Default hyperparameters provided a good balance between simplicity and performance, and no further tuning was required.

Other models tested included Logistic Regression (85% accuracy), which struggled with non-linear relationships, and Decision Tree (88% accuracy), which was prone to overfitting. Random Forest outperformed these alternatives, making it the best choice for this classification task.

## Question|Task 3

Instructions: 
Justify your classification model by discussing the most important features selected by your model. This discussion should include a feature importance chart and a description of the features.


Feature Importance
The Random Forest Classifier provides a measure of feature importance by evaluating how much each feature contributes to the accuracy of the model. The top features for predicting whether a house was built before 1980 are:

Condition (Grouped): Homes with lower condition ratings are more likely to have been built before 1980.
Square Footage (Live Area): Larger homes are more commonly associated with post-1980 construction.
Sale Price: Higher sale prices tend to correlate with homes built after 1980, likely reflecting more modern construction quality and amenities.
Quality: Homes with higher quality ratings are more likely to be built after 1980.

Info & Features: 
Condition and Quality: Both provide categorical insights into the maintenance and build quality of the homes, strongly correlating with the construction year.
Square Footage and Sale Price: These continuous variables represent the physical and financial characteristics of the homes, differentiating between older, smaller, and less expensive homes and modern, larger, and more expensive ones.

## Question|Task 4

Instructions: 
Describe the quality of your classification model using 2-3 different evaluation metrics. You also need to explain how to interpret each of the evaluation metrics you use.


Explanation of Metrics:

Accuracy: Indicates the percentage of correctly classified houses, achieving an accuracy of 92.43%, which exceeds the target of 90%. This shows the model performs well overall.
Precision and Recall:
Precision (No: 0.90, Yes: 0.94) shows that when the model predicts a house as being built before or after 1980, it is highly accurate.
Recall (No: 0.89, Yes: 0.95) indicates the model’s ability to correctly identify all houses built before or after 1980, minimizing false negatives.
F1-Score:
Combines precision and recall into a single metric, achieving 0.90 (No) and 0.94 (Yes), demonstrating the model’s balance between the two metrics.
Confusion Matrix: The confusion matrix provides a detailed view:

2260 houses correctly classified as "No."
4093 houses correctly classified as "Yes."
282 and 238 houses misclassified for "No" and "Yes," respectively.
