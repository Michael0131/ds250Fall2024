__Highlight the Questions and Tasks__

## Question|Task 1

Instructions:

Shorten the column names and clean them up for easier use with pandas. Provide a table or list that exemplifies how you fixed the names.

What was done:
To complete this task, I shortened and cleaned up column names for easier use with pandas. I replaced verbose names with concise, readable alternatives, such as changing "Have you seen any of the 6 films in the Star Wars franchise?" to seen_any, and applied consistent snake_case formatting throughout. Additionally, I resolved encoding issues in column names and removed meaningless unnamed columns.

```{python}
#| label: Q1
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here
import pandas as pd

# Define the file path
file_path = "StarWars.csv"

# Load the dataset with error handling for encoding
try:
    data = pd.read_csv(file_path, encoding='utf-8')
except UnicodeDecodeError:
    print("UTF-8 decoding failed. Trying 'latin1' encoding...")
    data = pd.read_csv(file_path, encoding='latin1')

# Display the first few rows to confirm successful loading
print("Dataset Loaded Successfully. First few rows:")
print(data.head())

# Original column names
original_column_names = data.columns.tolist()
print("\nOriginal Column Names:")
print(original_column_names)

# Define a dictionary to map original names to cleaned names
column_mapping = {
    "RespondentID": "respondent_id",
    "Have you seen any of the 6 films in the Star Wars franchise?": "seen_any",
    "Do you consider yourself to be a fan of the Star Wars film franchise?": "is_fan",
    "Star Wars: Episode I  The Phantom Menace": "seen_episode_1",
    "Star Wars: Episode II  Attack of the Clones": "seen_episode_2",

    "Please rank the Star Wars films in order of preference with 1 being your favorite film in the franchise and 6 being your least favorite film. - Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi": "rank_episode_6",
    "Which character shot first?": "character_shot_first",
    "Are you familiar with the Expanded Universe?": "familiar_eu",
    "Do you consider yourself to be a fan of the Expanded Universe?Do you consider yourself to be a fan of the Expanded Universe?\x8cæ": "is_fan_expanded_universe",
    "Do you consider yourself to be a fan of the Star Trek franchise?": "is_fan_star_trek",
    "Gender": "gender",
    "Age": "age",
    "Household Income": "income",
    "Education": "education",
    "Location (Census Region)": "location"
}

# Apply the renaming
data.rename(columns=column_mapping, inplace=True)

# Drop unnamed columns if they hold no useful data
unnamed_columns = [col for col in data.columns if col.startswith('Unnamed:')]
data.drop(columns=unnamed_columns, inplace=True)

# Display the cleaned column names
cleaned_column_names = data.columns.tolist()
print("\nCleaned Column Names:")
print(cleaned_column_names)

# Save the cleaned dataset for future steps
data.to_csv("StarWars_Cleaned.csv", index=False)

## Question|Task 2

Instructions:
Clean and format the data so that it can be used in a machine learning model. As you format the data, you should complete each item listed below. In your final report provide example(s) of the reformatted data with a short description of the changes made.

- Filter the dataset to respondents that have seen at least one film
- Create a new column that converts the age ranges to a single number. Drop the age range categorical column
- Create a new column that converts the education groupings to a single number. Drop the school categorical column
- Create a new column that converts the income ranges to a single number. Drop the income range categorical column
- Create your target (also known as “y” or “label”) column based on the new income range column
- One-hot encode all remaining categorical columns
